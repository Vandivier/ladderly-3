This article will reduce your stress and increase your compensation. For individuals with more than one year of experience, this article provides techniques guaranteed to improve offers by thousands of dollars. For Director+ roles, this article describes a guaranteed path to $20k+ improvements with much higher average improvements.

## Obtaining a Guaranteed Compensation Increase

The simple trick to getting a guaranteed increase is to use a service that offers a guarantee. There are two that Ladderly.io recommends.

[Interviewing.io](https://iio.sh/r/1OhF) is our top choice with a 94% success rate. They get get users an average of $50K more in cash and $70K more in total comp. They have a $10k guarantee. If you do not increase compensation by 10k then you pay nothing. If you succeed to get an increase over $10k, they charge the greater of $3,000 or 10% of the difference between your initial offer and final offer. They only count equity toward TC for public companies.

To access their Salary Negotiation service, sign up [here](https://iio.sh/r/1OhF) then look for the dollar icon along their navigation menu from the dashboard after logging in.

The second recommended service is [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/services/), which offers lower costs or higher guaranteed increases for people in certain situations, such as Principal level ICs and Director+ roles. For Director+ roles, they guarantee an increase of $20k a cost of only $5k. Their package includes some nice elements like 6 months of support across all your offers.

These services come at a cost. If you want to try to keep a little more for yourself, study up by reading the rest of this article!

## The Job Search Snowball

Competing offers are one of the strongest negotiation tools. Ordering the interviews in your job search from least preferred first to most preferred role last creates a job search snowball that allows you to prepare for strong performance in later interviews. If you are able to get an offer, it will also increase leverage for later interviews.

## Negotiation Starts Before the Recruiter Call

The job search snowball demonstrates one way in which negotiation for role n begins before the recruiter screen for role n. You also want to come to that call prepared for the question on desired compensation. Here are some brief tips to prepare:

1. Research the company a bit and prepare an elevator pitch. Smile and appear excited about the role.
2. Prepare stories of impact and ensure your resume and LinkedIn profile communicate this even before you apply.
3. If you can get a referral, do it!
4. Have a high anchor number in mind, a target number, and a cutoff number where you are prepared to walk away. You can also go through the process anyway as practice.

## Always Be Collecting Leverage and Intel

Besides active employment and a competing offer, your main source of leverage is interview performance.

Intel is another powerful tool. Understanding the role gives you insight into how the employer will derive a return on investment from hiring you. This helps you build a case that you are a great investment. You may be able to make a case that you can provide value even above what they expect.

The job post itself is a location of intel, as is every interview round. When you get the opportunity to ask questions, leverage it to this end. Seek to understand felt pain points in the team and collect data around tasks you could execute to drive impact on this specific team. You can build a 30/60/90 Day Plan or a 6-Month Plan showing how you will onboard effectively and drive rapid impact. Later on you might present this to a hiring manager or even their manager to get an exception for above-band pay.

The negotiation will be an asymmetric information game. Always be collecting information and 4. [don't reveal any information](http://interviewing.io/blog/sabotage-salary-negotiation-before-even-start). Punt on negotiation until you receive an offer. Emphasize that you are interested in the role and you're confident you can make something work.

## Detecting and Resolving a Lowball Offer

Many job posts will list the base pay range for a role and you can also often just ask about the pay range. Websites like [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) also contain information about what companies typically pay.

If either of the following happens, you have been lowballed:

1. You are paid below the middle of the pay band.
2. You and the team agreed early in the process to a target range and they have now made an offer below that range.

Solving a lowball offer is similar to making a counteroffer of any kind, but now you have two additional tools:

1. You can use curiosity about their justification for the low offer to uncover specific pain points which you can address directly to renegotiate.
2. You can hold them accountable for their comments and agreements made during the process.

## Preparing a Counteroffer

One technique is to use an excitement sandwich. Something like:

```txt
Thanks so much for the offer! I loved chatting with the team and learning about the role. I'm now more confident ever that I will be able to drive impact and grow.

I do have some hesitation around < compensation or whatever you are negotiating for >.

I'm eager to work through this and join the company!
```

Here are some elements to consider:

1. Ask for non-compensation benefits like additional days of remote work each week.
2. Possibly leaving out concrete numbers and just specify your pain point. See if they will come up on their own.
3. Consider making an A/B sell where one option is higher base and the other overweighs equity and bonuses with less base.
4. Avoiding ultimatums is typically advisable.

## Won't My Offer Get Pulled?

One study indicates that [companies pull about 6% of the offers they make](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/salary-negotiations/should-you-negotiate-a-job-offer/), and the main reason is a rude candidate. It pays to negotiate without being rude!

Pulling 6% of all offers probably understates the percent of negotiated offers pulled for two reasons:

1. Most candidates don't negotiate, and those that do negotiate may be perceived as rude at higher rates. [A 2023 Pew study](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/05/when-negotiating-starting-salaries-most-us-women-and-men-dont-ask-for-higher-pay/) found that 60% of employed adults did not negotiate.
2. [A 2013 Salary.com study](https://www.salary.com/chronicles/salary-negotiation-separating-fact-from-fiction/) found that 87% of employers "said they've never rescinded a job offer following negotiations during the interview, and no employers -- that's zero percent -- reported demoting or firing an existing employee simply for asking for a raise."

So the risk seems like 10% at first glance and a bit lower if you are careful not to be rude.

With expert assistance, the risk is further reduced. See the section on Obtaining a Guaranteed Compensation Increase, where Interviewing.io has a 94% success rate. Among the 6% that did not obtain increased compensation, they didn't all have offers pulled.
