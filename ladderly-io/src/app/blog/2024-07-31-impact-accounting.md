## July 2024 Notes

In June of 2024, [John ran a poll](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/john-vandivier_i-wonder-how-much-overlap-my-network-has-activity-7206670687346851840-cept) that found that half of his LinkedIn followers were exclusive to LinkedIn. Unique Social Media Followers are estimated by extrapolating this pattern. A 50% multiplier is added to each non-primary network and those counts are summed with the count of followers on the primary channel, which is currently TikTok.

By July 2024, Ladderly.io had exceeded 15 million organic social impressions!

The Ladderly.io open source ecosystem consists of 790+ commits from seven individual contributors across five repositories, earning 58 stars. The projects are:

1.  [ladderly-3](https://github.com/Vandivier/ladderly-3), which has over 105k lines of code.
2.  [ladderly-slides](https://github.com/Vandivier/ladderly-slides)
3.  [arias-tale-rpg](https://github.com/Vandivier/arias-tale-rpg)
4.  [rect](https://github.com/Vandivier/rect)
5.  [redyellowgreen](https://github.com/Vandivier/redyellowgreen)

Ladderly.io completed its first small group cohort.

Ladderly.io open source work has resulted in improvements to Pyodide, Blitz.js, and other notable projects.
