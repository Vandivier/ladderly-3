## Why the Resume Matters

[99% of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics) use an applicant tracking system (ATS). Only 20% of smaller businesses use an ATS, and [recruiters don't read most of your resume](https://interviewing.io/blog/why-resume-writing-is-snake-oil), so is it worth investing time and effort into your resume if you are not targeting Fortune 500?

The answer is yes, because your experience items function as talking points. Refining the experience items in your resume is a forcing function to ensure that you are able to describe your experience in a concise and impactful way. This will pay off in [social networking messages](/blog/2025-01-20-social-networking-scripts), recruiter screens, [behavioral interviews](/blog/2025-02-24-behavioral-interviews), and more!

## The Job Search as a Sales Funnel

A high-quality resume is associated with standard efficacy in the application to interview ratio. A high-quality resume is easier to read for both humans and scanning programs such as the ATS. Before we dive in to making an ATS-friendly resume, this section highlights the need for a broader job search strategy that improves overall job search performance:

A low-quality resume will directly and indirectly reduce your job search performance and a high-quality resume acts as a performance multiplier across multiple stages of the job search. As a multiplier, resume optimization alone only provides a modest benefit. It is imperitive to supplement the resume with a high-quality LinkedIn profile and social networking techniques to achieve a higher overall application to interview ratio. For empirical data on effect sizes, see [15. On Cover Letters and Resume Tailoring](https://www.ladderly.io/blog/2024-08-04-no-cover-letters).

A low-quality resume is one which fails technical parsing tests described in this article. High-quality resumes broadly are those that are both machine-parseable and also persuasive to humans. The human persuasion bit causes subjectivity and variation among high-quality resumes. Ladderly.io data indicates that tailoring each resume to a particular job post is typically not a high return on investment activity, but it is worth testing resumes tailored at the job family level, for individuals applying to multiple job families. In order to confirm whether a resume is performing, Ladderly.io strongly encourages A/B testing resume variations in the job search.

To A/B test a resume, it is important to apply to a substantial count of job posts and collect standardized information for each job post, so that you can determine the effect of the resume itself. A common pitfall for job seekers is to try out multiple resume variations without obtaining sufficient data to prove an actual lift in performance. This resume shuffling often becomes a source of wasted time, effort, and stress. In general, as long as your resume is parseable then your time is usually best spent on additional social networking and applying, rather than crafting many varied resume versions.

To enable statistical analysis of your A/B test, Ladderly.io recommends applying to a minimum of 40 job posts for each resume under analysis. This aligns with [our recommendation of applying to between 80 and 100 positions per week](https://www.ladderly.io/blog/2023-12-01-top-job-boards#final-thoughts), under the assumption that you are A/B testing two resume versions.

Expect A/B testing two resumes to take 3 weeks. You will want to look at the 1 week lagged response rate as your performance measure in order to minimize truncation bias in your analysis. In other words, employers take time to respond, so your last applications will tend to not have a response. You shouldn't confuse that with the quality of the resume itself.

If you have collected 80+ 1-week lagged results and the resumes are not performing significantly differently, just call it a tie. In most cases, the resume won't be your job search bottleneck and either resume will work well enough.

In the rare case where you are getting a response rate under 1 percent, you should consult with an expert and you can consider A/B testing a third resume version. Carefully weigh the tradeoff and risk of doing this to other possible options, such as ramping up social networking.

The tools in the next section can help you perform and analyze an A/B test.

## Job Search Spreadsheet Tools

1. Here's [Ladderly.io's Premium Job Tracker Tool](/job-tracker)
2. Here's a free [post-level job tracker spreadsheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRL8zSSgDAQ_Rs5kHglUEZnH4-kQwLnXZ0e9oh0YvK0)
3. Stay tuned for a round-level spreadsheet!

You can optionally fill out one of these spreadsheets then click File -> Download -> Comma Seperated Values (.csv) and import that file into the [Job Tracker Tool](/job-tracker).

The round-level spreadsheet allows richer data analysis but requires more data entry, because you will need to create a new row for each interview round. The post-level spreadsheet just has one row for each job post. This is easier to utilize but there are some limitations on the analysis you can do with it.

Specifically, you won't get quantitative data on performance for different round types. You may be able to determine this well enough by reflection without precise data analysis, so it might not be a big issue for you.

## Parsing and Keyword Density

There are a variety of ATS tools on the market of varying quality, but [Ladderly.io research shows a consistent bar of resume performance](https://www.ladderly.io/blog/2024-08-04-no-cover-letters#an-original-contribution-of-data) with a variety of resumes that meet the following criteria:

1. [enhancv](https://enhancv.com/) ATS Parse Rate at 100%. Note that their ATS Parse Rate is a specific subscore which is not the same as their overall resume score.
2. An overall resume score of 70+ on [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/)

You may find that further changes to your resume make it easier to upload to particular websites, but such changes will generally be a matter of saving you time on particular websites, rather than a general improvement to your job search performance.

In addition, many employers rank resumes based on keyword density, with respect to keywords that vary by job post. Ladderly.io recommends repeating skill keywords for targets skills 3 times in the resume.

## Writing a Persuasive Resume

Now that your resume is parseable by machines, here are some tips to building a resume which is preferred by humans. While ATS parsing typically does not require an A/B test, some of these are more subjective. If you personally feel that any of these tips reduce the quality of your resume, simply A/B test each version to build confidence in the particular performance of each version:

1. Include 3-5 line items for each experience block. Line items should include relevant skill keywords and demonstrated quantitative impact.
2. Ensure your name, email, LinkedIn, and GitHub profile are at the top of the resume with effective click handlers.
3. Print your resume to PDF for application and scanning purposes.
4. Target a [1-2 page resume with 500-600 words](https://youtu.be/sNbOUAkgxCo?si=Rt1nRCJ3tzEbTU9S&t=180).
5. Omit graduation dates, grade point averages, and paragraphs of text outside of experience blocks.
6. If you have more than 15 years of experience, A/B test a truncated form of your resume which only mentions the most recent 15 years of experience.
7. Prefer a simple single-column format with only black and white font. Leverage bold or blue text color to highlight important keywords or key phrases.

Consider using [this open source resume template](https://github.com/Vandivier/my-resume) as a basis which incorporates many of these guidelines. A language model tool can help you quickly update content in the template with your own data.

## LinkedIn Optimization

Before applying you should optimize your LinkedIn. This includes describing your education and experience on LinkedIn, linking your GitHub portfolio, adding projects, highlighting skills associated with those resume items, updating your title line, and providing a high-quality profile picture. Avoid demeaning self-labels such as referring to yourself as a junior.

It's important to ensure that you have a high-quality LinkedIn and GitHub before applying, because your resume will include links to those pages. In addition, LinkedIn now provides a resume generator that uses the content from your LinkedIn profile to generate an ATS-friendly resume.

LinkedIn connection count has a significant impact on your job search performance. Having more than 500 connections is associated with much stronger job search performance. LinkedIn Premium is also a powerful tool. Premium members are [2.6x more likely to get hired](https://premium.linkedin.com/career-features) on LinkedIn.

[Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/) has an automated LinkedIn profile review tool. This tool can currently check text in your profile but it cannot analyze your profile picture and other media. It also does not analyze your posts or comments. Having an overall score over 50 does not guarantee a high-quality profile, but it is a useful indicator to protect against a definitely low-quality profile.

## Indeed and Other Job Boards

The same job post may be posted to multiple job boards, but different companies prioritize different channels, and different job boards have varying efficacy in their ability to parse and promote your profile. [Here is a list of job boards](https://www.ladderly.io/blog/2023-12-01-top-job-boards#the-top-recommended-job-boards) that Ladderly.io recommends.

While applying on a company website is typically best in terms of the rate of conversion to interview, using a job board that has an ability to apply with your job board profile is much better than not applying at all. Job boards can also make discovery of interesting job opportunities easier for you.

Take advantage of features like job alerts and filters for recency to improve your application to interview ratio. [Research from Paul van der Laken](https://paulvanderlaken.com/2017/10/24/talent-works-data-science-to-improve-job-application-chances/) and [others](https://chatgpt.com/share/67c647fe-fd84-800d-b43b-a10dfa893c6b) indicates that:

1. Applications submitted between 2-4 days after a job is posted have the highest chance of getting an interview. You have up to an 8x higher chance of getting an interview during this period, sometimes called the Golden Hours or Golden Window.
2. Applications submitted to an open role after 10 days have an interview probability around 1.5%. This is sometimes called a Black Hole Scenario or the Resume Blackhole.

These statistics are important markers but the do miss some nuance. For instance, if you encounter a hiring manager seeking applications for a role, it is probably smart to connect and apply even if the role has been up for a while. You may be getting an early signal that the role will be reposted or the applicants processed so far have not been satisfactory. Statistics on typical application rates are not representative of edge cases like these. When in doubt, go ahead an apply!
