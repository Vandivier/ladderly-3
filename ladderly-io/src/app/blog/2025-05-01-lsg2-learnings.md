Ladderly Small Group (LSG) Cohort 2 provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of our small group coaching program and highlighted areas for improvement in expectation setting and program design. This article shares key learnings from the cohort's experience and outcomes.

## Background Context

LSG2 was led by John Vandivier, a Staff Software Engineer in Applied AI at Guideline, where he serves as Tech Lead for the Gen AI team. With a Ph.D. in Economics and experience as a self-taught programmer and former political consultant, John brings a unique perspective to career development, particularly in supporting career switchers and senior ICs.

The program built upon several established Ladderly.io practices and John's recent experiences:

1. **Data-Driven Job Search Approach**

   - Weekly reflection and adaptation based on metrics
   - Focus on statistically significant signals through high-volume application (50-100/week for non-seniors, half that for seniors)
   - Emphasis on tracking and measuring outcomes

2. **Social Media and Networking Strategy**

   - Daily social media posting with positive content focus
   - Strategic LinkedIn optimization and networking
   - Point-of-contact outreach for every application
   - Professional headshot and keyword-rich profiles

3. **Technical Preparation Framework**

   - Advanced behavioral interview preparation
   - System design practice through recommended resources
   - Portfolio development with modern tech stack integration

4. **Time Management and Hustle**

   - Structured weekly planning
   - Focus on consistent, deliberate effort
   - Balance between application volume and interview preparation

5. **Professional Development Tools**
   - Resume optimization for ATS parsing
   - Quantified impact statements
   - Strategic use of career coaching and interview preparation services

These established practices formed the foundation for LSG2, with the cohort providing valuable feedback and insights for further refinement.

## LSG2 Cohort Overview

LSG2 was a senior-leaning small group focused on job search optimization. The cohort attracted significant interest with 60 initial expressions of interest, 18 completed applications, and 14 admitted students. Admission criteria included factors like sponsorship status, ensuring participants could fully engage with the program's opportunities.

## Program Structure and Participation

The program experienced notable attrition:

- 7 students dropped within the first two weeks
- 3 more dropped by month two
- 4 students remained active at the two-month mark and stayed to close at 6 months

All four students that stayed to close obtained work offers of varying quality:

- Two got competitive full-time offers
- One got part-time freelancing work they describe as "consistent...solid work, pays the bills [with one client] talking about getting me and my buddy on for 6-12 months"
- One got an equity-only offer

All students with measured outcomes showed significant improvement in their job search metrics, even those who dropped out early. The most common reason for dropping was program cost. Example job search metrics include the application to interview ratio, interviews per week, and the interview pass rate.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Expectation Management

One critical learning was the importance of clear expectation setting. Some participants joined with misconceptions about the program's offerings, such as expecting immediate executive introductions before completing foundational work. This highlighted the need for:

- Clear communication about program features and prerequisites
- Transparent discussion of typical outcomes and timelines
- Emphasis on the sequential nature of job search optimization

### 2. Outcome Patterns

The data revealed several important patterns:

- Measurable improvements typically require 1-2 months to manifest
- Early dropouts still benefited from initial resume reviews and resource recommendations
- Success metrics showed significant improvements:
  - Application to interview ratios improved 1.5-10x
  - Networking performance increased
  - Interview performance enhanced

### 3. Success Stories

At the two-month mark, the active participants demonstrated strong progress:

- One student secured a job offer
- One student was in an ongoing FAANG interview process
- Two students had active interviews at non-FAANG companies

Even among early dropouts, at least one secured a new position.

### 4. Program Design Insights

The experience highlighted several program design considerations:

- Price sensitivity among participants
- The importance of managing burnout and job search fatigue
- The value of early wins and quick feedback loops
- The need for clear communication about typical job search timelines

### 5. Most Impactful Practices

Participants reported several key practices that significantly improved their job search outcomes, including a mix of established and novel practices:

1. **Enhanced Profile Review Tools**

   - Leveraging new validation tools from Enhancv and Resume Worded
   - Comprehensive LinkedIn and resume optimization
   - Professional headshot and keyword-rich profiles

2. **LinkedIn Premium Features**

   - Initial skepticism about Premium's value was overcome
   - Strategic use of "Add Note" feature for new connections
   - Effective InMail outreach to hiring managers and team members

3. **Strategic Application Timing**

   - Focus on the "Golden Window" of job postings
   - Avoiding the "Black Hole" of stale or overly competitive postings
   - Prioritizing recently posted positions

4. **Job Family Focus**

   - Narrowing focus to specific job families
   - Avoiding scattered applications across multiple roles
   - Building targeted expertise and messaging

5. **Group Accountability**

   - Regular meetings with peers in job search
   - Shared progress tracking and motivation
   - Cross-role learning and support
   - Particularly impactful for specialized roles like Data Engineering

6. **Novel Messaging Strategy**

   - Celebrating new hires at target companies
   - Building rapport through congratulatory messages
   - Following up with specific questions about hiring
   - Developed by Adam Cragg ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acragg/))
   - Detailed approach to be shared in upcoming Ladderly blog post

7. **Ladderly Leetcode Kata**

   - Instructor-facilitated introductions to key stakeholders
   - Early awareness of exclusive job postings
   - Direct access to hiring managers and team leads
   - Particularly valuable for top performers
   - Note: While not guaranteed, this element significantly contributed to interview success rates

## Future Improvements

Based on these learnings, Ladderly.io is implementing several improvements:

1. Enhanced pre-program communication about:

   - Typical outcomes and timelines
   - Program features and prerequisites
   - Realistic expectations for executive networking

2. Better support for managing job search fatigue and burnout

3. More structured tracking of outcomes across all participants, including early dropouts

4. Clearer communication about the 2-6 month typical job search timeline

5. Pre-screening for cognitive and non-cognitive ability as well as technical ability.

## Conclusion

LSG2 provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of our small group coaching model while highlighting areas for improvement. The cohort demonstrated that even with significant attrition, the program can deliver meaningful improvements in job search outcomes. Future cohorts will benefit from these learnings through improved expectation setting and program design.

Stay tuned for 3-6 month updates as we continue tracking outcomes and refining our approach based on this valuable experience.
