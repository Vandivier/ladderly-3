## Setup

There are as many messaging strategies as there are hours in a day. There isn’t much rhyme or reason in what specific messaging works or doesn’t work to get the attention of your target. It’s the same idea as resumes in the sense that what appeals to one recruiter may be really off-putting for another.

With that in mind, we can pull some lessons from salespeople on what works in their profession. We are after all just salesmen where the product we’re selling is ourselves.

## Strategies

One strategy is to mix in a question with your initial outreach attempt. It should be something that doesn’t take a huge time commitment from the contact. Asking for a coffee chat is not practical due to the fact that there is only so much time in the day. It doesn’t scale well to the likely hundreds of messages recruiters and hiring managers are receiving in their inboxes on a daily basis.

I’ve had some success with asking the following:

`What can I do to make my job application stand out?”`

The goal isn’t to get a concrete answer but to get the target communicating. Initiating contact will usually be the hardest part of an outreach attempt.

Another strategy I’ve had some success with is what I like to call the `let them brag` approach. Everyone loves to brag about themselves to some degree. Again, the idea is to simply get the target talking. I’m a software engineer and have some traction with the following message:

`Congrats on getting hired in this job market. It feels damn near impossible to get hired into software engineering roles atm.`

This messaging fits nicely into the `let them brag` approach. It also appeals to another aspect of humanity that isn’t often talked about, the appearance of being vulnerable. People generally want to help you if they can, and this messaging appeals to that side of people. Most recruiters I’ve tried this messaging on usually try to schedule interviews. The only requirement here is that your target has recently posted about starting a role at a new company.

## Conclusion

The most effective messaging is often the simplest. Strategies that depend on researching people and companies can work, but require a lot of time and effort to pull off. The strategies I went over in this article require minimal effort to implement.
