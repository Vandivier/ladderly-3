          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700">Our Core Values</h2>
          <ol className="mt-4 list-decimal pl-5">
            <li>
              <strong>Generosity & Community</strong>: Ladderly thrives on mutual support. Members
              help each other learn, grow, and succeed. Our strength lies in our community.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Freedom</strong>: We value freedom. We champion free services to uplift all,
              especially those less privileged. We value open source and open science.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Open Source</strong>: We advocate for open-source technology. The curriculum
              we teach, the research we produce, and this website are all open source!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Science</strong>: At Ladderly, we emphasize data-driven and evidence-based
              strategies for our students. We continuously experiment, learn, share back with the
              community, and improve our tools based on what we find.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Diversity</strong>: Our community thrives on diverse minds coming together.
              Multiple perspectives, united by a shared vision, lead us to truth and innovation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Personalized & Intelligent Defaults</strong>: We are literally immune to
              analysis paralysis! Instead of overwhelming choices, we present intelligent defaults,
              with prioritized alternatives and fallback strategies if the primary approach doesn
              {`'`}t work for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Curation & Humility</strong>: We celebrate the expertise of others. If someone
              else does it better, we happily refer you to external resources, instead of trying to
              be the best at everything. Partnership, honesty, and continuous improvement are our
              cornerstones. Curation is a major part of our value proposition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quality of Life</strong>: We endorse a high-performance lifestyle, underpinned
              by health, rest, and joy. Celebrate achievements, big or small, and advance your
              skills and career, without encouraging workaholism or other unhealthy habits.
            </li>
